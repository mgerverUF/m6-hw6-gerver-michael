### Assignment Issues
I had no issues with this assignment.

### Outside Sources
I used some of my class notes from *Advanced Web 1* last semester and some notes from this class as a reference.

I used https://answers.unity.com/questions/43076/in-a-function-how-do-i-access-a-variable-of-anothe.html to figure out that if I want to use a variable in multiple functions I need to declare the variable outside of the functions.

I used https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html-dom-appendchild-method for additional guidance with the appendChild method.

I used https://www.peterbe.com/plog/createelement-a for additional guidence on setting attributes of elements created in Javascript.
